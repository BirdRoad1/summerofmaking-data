25	FIXAPL	JacobL	/projects/1890	FIXAPL is a programming language inspired by APL, re-imagined using fixed-arity functions all the way down. APL is a language which uses special characters as function names and multidimensional arrays as the primary datatype, allowing for very concise and elegant code. Fixed-arity means that contrary to other APL dialects, there are no variadic functions. That seems like it would be a disadvantage, but it actually provides a lot of benefits, aiding readability of the language as well as providing more expressive tacit (point-free) forms of construction.	2654	24	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjY4NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1cf2b6f4ecebf02abee1f8810f77df750127637e/Screenshot%202025-06-19%20at%202.42.39%20PM.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://fixapl.netlify.app/	2025-06-19 18:41:59.357	2025-07-09 14:44:55.889	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jacob-Lockwood/fixapl/main/README.md	https://github.com/Jacob-Lockwood/fixapl	U091REGFRM1	2025-07-10 11:52:24.787

53	Website and Android App for School After class 	Imjack1	/projects/255	Project Name\nTechnikTeam - Event & Crew Management System\n\nElevator Pitch\nI replaced my school A/V club's chaotic spreadsheets and group chats with a full-stack web app that manages everything: event scheduling, crew assignments, and a QR-code-powered gear inventory.\n\nDetailed Description\nOur school's event tech crew was a mess. To fix it, I built TechnikTeam, a custom web platform that acts as the single source of truth for all our operations. It's a full-stack Java application designed to bring order and professionalism to our student-run events.\n\n🚀 Core Features:\n\nEvent Scheduling & Crewing: Plan events, define roles (like "sound tech"), and assign crew members based on their skills.\nLive Event Dashboard: During a show, assigned members get a real-time dashboard with a group chat and a shared task list to stay in sync.\nQR-Powered Inventory: Catalog all our gear. Anyone can scan a QR code on a piece of equipment to see what it is and where it belongs, and crew members can check items in or out.\nInteractive Skills Matrix: A huge grid that visually tracks which crew members are trained on which equipment, making it easy to find the right person for the job.\nRole-Based Access: A full admin panel for leaders and a streamlined view for student crew members.\nTech Stack\nJava (Servlets/JSP), MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Apache Tomcat.\n\nWhat I Learned\nFull-Stack Development: I built the entire system myself, from designing the relational database schema in MySQL to coding the backend logic in Java and building the dynamic frontend with JSP and JavaScript.\nSolving a Real Problem: This wasn't a tutorial. I had to talk to my crew, understand their pain points, and design features that actually made their lives easier.\nComplex Systems Design: I learned how to architect interconnected features, like making the inventory reservations appear on the event pages and building the complex data queries needed for the interactive skills matrix.	2901	20	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU1NzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--bdb52e44dee719e56d3ea873e8c16ce50dc87ede/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20at%2000-02-02%20-%20TechnikTeam.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-16 20:22:16.243	2025-06-24 06:34:32.934		https://github.com/Imjack1-cyber/TechnikTeam	U091MUWD64V	2025-07-10 11:52:27.539

182	Vidminal	SK	/projects/3044	📺 Vidminal: Terminal Video as ASCII Art\n\n--- WHAT IS THIS THING, ANYWAY?! ---\n🤔 ► Ever wished you could watch videos... in your terminal? 🤯\n🤨 ► NO? Well, I DON'T CARE, HERE IT IS. 🤷‍♀️\n👀 ► You've seen ASCII art demos. You've seen those looping gifs. Cute. 😏 This ain't that.\n✨ ► Vidminal takes [ANY] video file you throw at it—your favorite anime clip 🎬, a movie 🍿, that weird cat video from 2009 😼—and turns it into a live, colorful, animated ASCII art spectacle right in your terminal.\n🎶 ► And it's not just a silent movie. We've got synchronized audio. 🔊 We've got full controls. 🎮 This isn't a toy; it's a legit, if slightly unhinged, [TERMINAL MEDIA PLAYER]. 🚀\n\n---\n\n--- HOW'D I MAKE IT HAPPEN? ---\n🐍 ► It's a Python party! 🎉\n💪 ► I wrangled some of Python's coolest libraries to pull this off:\n🎬 ► `moviepy` & `ffmpeg`: To rip the video and audio apart. ✂️\n🖼️ ► `Pillow`: For the pixel-to-text magic. ✍️\n🔈 ► `pygame`: To blast the sound waves at your ears. 🎧\n🎨 ► `colorama`: To paint everything in glorious 24-bit color. 🌈\n⚡ ► `threading`: To make sure the controls work while the video is playing, because nobody likes a laggy player.\n🗺️ ► It was a journey fueled by caffeine ☕ and a questionable sense of purpose. 🌀\n\n---\n\n--- WHY IS IT AWESOME? ---\n🌟 ► It's pure, unfiltered, terminal power! ✨\n🕹️ ► TOTAL CONTROL: You get a full-fledged player experience. Pause, play, quit, rewind, and fast-forward. Adjust the volume. Mute the chaos. It's all there. ⏯️🎚️\n📦 ► ZERO SETUP: Download the release for your OS and just... run it. 🚀 I bundled `ffmpeg` so you don't have to install a single thing. I did the boring work for you. You're welcome. 🙏\n✅ ► THE BEST PART: YOU ARE THE ARTIST! 🎨 Don't like the default look? Open `options.json` and:\n✍️ ► [CHANGE THE CHARACTERS!] Use `█▓▒░` for a blocky look, or a detailed set like `$@B%8&...`, or even make your own `custom` set! You control the texture of your video! 字符✨\n🎛️ ► [TWEAK THE VISUALS!] Adjust `gamma` and `contrast` to get that perfect moody, cyberpunk, or over-saturated look. ⚙️📊\n🤯 ► Prepare for your friends to look over your shoulder and go, "WTF?! Is that... a movie... in your terminal?" 😲\n👍 ► Yes. Yes it is. 😎	1108	12	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjAxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c0f9bc1a0c81fc468f25ec69ab1ccb18e3ad8dec/image.png	Command Line Tool	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://github.com/SajagIN/vidminal/releases	2025-06-23 02:36:26.227	2025-07-02 02:17:53.705	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SajagIN/vidminal/main/README.md	https://github.com/SajagIN/vidminal	U08PGAD2KC1	2025-07-10 11:52:42.046

491	LumosLearn	Manthan Jindal	/projects/5264	LumosLearn started with a simple but powerful idea: education should be equal, no matter where you're born or what resources you have. Growing up, I realized that while some students have access to amazing teachers, digital tools, and support systems — millions of others don’t. Especially in rural or underserved communities, learning often stops because of things completely out of a student’s control. I couldn’t ignore that.\n\nThat’s when I decided to work on LumosLearn — not just as another tech project, but as a mission-driven effort to reimagine what learning could look like for everyone. The goal is to make sure that no student is left behind because of geography, income, or lack of infrastructure. I believe every learner deserves a chance to reach their full potential, and that belief is at the core of everything I’ve built.\n\nLumosLearn is all about creating fair and inclusive learning opportunities — whether it’s through personalized content, adaptive support, or simply making education feel more human and approachable. It's not about replacing teachers or schools. It's about supporting students who’ve been left out for too long and giving them the tools they need to rise.\n\nThis project is my way of taking a stand for educational equity — of using what I know and what I love (technology, learning, and solving real-world problems) to try and make a meaningful difference.\n\nIf you’re inspired by this idea, I’d really appreciate it if you respected the originality and intent behind it. Please help keep LumosLearn’s mission authentic — not copied, but supported in spirit.	1837	7	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY1MzEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--09ffb9dff0e303f85d51f84890673f3a77d91305/Screenshot%202025-07-05%20105122.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://lumoslearn.tech/	2025-07-04 09:00:48.636	2025-07-05 05:24:05.163	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manthanjindal/LumosLearn/refs/heads/main/README.md	https://github.com/manthanjindal/LumosLearn	U07BNJALA9G	2025-07-10 11:53:13.651

That person then passes the project onto another person who will be added to the repo\n    Repeat until the project is shipped!	289	4	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA4OTEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--d8e06936c624b0d7a8b8467b3a5988fb30325a0d/Screenshot_20250628_172426.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-19 02:56:43.954	2025-06-20 03:43:03.4			U08BBLLG6JE	2025-07-10 11:54:23.813

1268	LT25.py	joshpinto6	/projects/5740	A Python module  for interacting with LT25 guitar amplifiers! The features of this series of modeling guitar amps and the desktop app they come with didn't fulfill my needs. Wanting to find a way to still do cool things with my guitar gear, I decided to hack it. This library allows anyone with a knowledge of Python to connect, interface, and interact with the LT25 amplifier, enabling the development of custom apps, clients, clis, and infinite other tools.\n...\nThis project helps empower musicians and device-owners to take their devices' technical capabilities into their own hands. Through PyPI, the python package manager and `pip install lt25`, it can be integrated with any python (3.9+) application. It's also the first time I used USB devices in my software, marking a learning experience (I used AI to help debug my faulty packet-handling code) It also blends my passions for music and software, serves as my foray into networking with physical devices (through USB HID in this case) devices, and has opened the door for future projects I am currently working on including:\n...\n- my own CLI and desktop app\n- a Raspberry-pi-based footswitch slot controller (👀)\n...\n⭐ Star the GH repo and follow the org to stay up to date on releases, additional features, and new projects!	636	3	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgyNjAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--810998977afca4a2782f64a55d85d153cf96060e/bender-lt25-banner.png	Command Line Tool	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://joshpinto6.github.io/cdn/lt25pydemo.mp4	2025-07-07 20:33:32.237	2025-07-08 20:13:18.347	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bendertools/lt25.py/main/README.md	https://github.com/bendertools/lt25.py	U07VA44DNBA	2025-07-10 11:54:32.127

3328	Volume	Karman Chhatwal	/projects/2558	WAV files are a common file format for representing audio. WAV files store audio as a sequence of “samples”: numbers that represent the value of some audio signal at a particular point in time. WAV files begin with a 44-byte “header” that contains information about the file itself, including the size of the file, the number of samples per second, and the size of each sample. After the header, the WAV file contains a sequence of samples, each a single 2-byte (16-bit) integer representing the audio signal at a particular point in time.\n\nScaling each sample value by a given factor has the effect of changing the volume of the audio. Multiplying each sample value by 2.0, for example, will have the effect of doubling the volume of the origin audio. Multiplying each sample by 0.5, meanwhile, will have the effect of cutting the volume in half.\n\nIn a file called volume.c in a folder called volume, write a program to modify the volume of an audio file.\n\n\nThis project is a problem set from Week 4 of CS50x 2025.	173	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8906ae1d48d2a74e052c444e0a2c98dad9ca513c/image%20(1).png	Command Line Tool	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-21 14:15:49.737	2025-06-21 14:15:49.737		https://github.com/code50/120336831/tree/main/volume	U091PCWGNBX	2025-07-10 11:57:57.807

3382	EcoPantry	veds	/projects/2358	EcoPantry is a Maven based JavaFX application that aims to help solve the global climate crisis, billions of dollars in food waste, and money waste. EcoPantry allows users to login and scan receipts (w/ Google's Tesseract OCR), as well as auto-add groceries to let them keep track of what they have online. The application’s color-coded expiry date tracking prevents users from throwing food away too early and too late, and the implementation of APIs (TheMealDB) allows EcoPantry to recommend recipes for close-to-expiring foods. Statistics are also automatically generated to notify users on their food wastage, savings, and financial waste/savings. A points system is also built-in, rewarding users for good choices. A SQLite database is used to manage login, groceries, and almost everything pertaining to specific users.	418	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzc5OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1668e77c0ed0c9a573cd23e0036cbfedaa586e83/EcoPantryStartPage.jpg	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UgdY63E0FArBTKTOyDJR8R5lYKOs6hAf/view?usp=sharing	2025-06-20 23:58:05.928	2025-06-30 23:48:20.224	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkunamneni1/EcoPantry/refs/heads/main/README.md	https://github.com/vkunamneni1/EcoPantry	U08EJ303Q4U	2025-07-10 11:58:03.308

2265	Ideology Tracker	Aresito	/projects/1168	Enter a phrase and you'll see the closest matching political ideology\n\nThis is mostly a test as my first real project in Python--or any programming language for that matter. It simply keeps track of terms in a given phrase and returns a matching ideology based on the amount and kind of terms used in the phrase. It has no UI, it doesn't handle ties, and only recognizes words and not their context, so if you type in "I don't care about the workers and I dislike the idea of public ownership", it'll return the matching ideology as socialism.	108	2	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fea3789c6b57e29cf8884e7d738df18880223aa5/George-W-Bush.jpeg	Command Line Tool	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-18 00:01:51.353	2025-06-18 00:01:51.353	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aresito22/IdeologyTracker/main/README.md	https://github.com/aresito22/IdeologyTracker	U0922GHANJD	2025-07-10 11:56:12.723

2749	EasyGPA	Aanya	/projects/4870	About EasyGPA: EasyGPA is a GPA calculating web-app. It can calculate both your weighted and unweighted GPAs based on just the number of classes you are taking and your grades in each of them! EasyGPA includes an aesthetic sunset themed UI to ensure that the web-app is pleasing to the eye and not just plain white (which is pretty boring to the user). EasyGPA has been proven to be 100% accurate, and if you don't trust me, you can compare your GPA calculated by EasyGPA with your GPA on your report card (when you receive it). They should be exactly the same!\n\nWhat EasyGPA does: EasyGPA takes two different user inputs for the unweighted GPA - one is the number of classes and the other is the user's grade in each class. For the weighted GPA, it takes three user inputs with the extra one being the class level. After the user inputs have been filled out, EasyGPA then assigns each grade a certain number of grade points based on the standard GPA scale from College Board, calculates the sum of all of the grade points, and divides the sum by the number of classes to get a final GPA!\n\nWhy I made EasyGPA: I made EasyGPA because as a a high school student, I am always eager to know what my GPA is (unweighted and weighted) before my report card is sent out at the end of the year. In the past, I have resorted to ChatGPT for calculating my GPA, but it turns out that ChatGPT gave me a totally wrong result. Thus, I tried GPA calculators available on the internet, but the majority of those asked for the number of "credits" each of my classes are worth and I had no idea what that meant! If I left that field empty, the website wouldn't even let me calculate my GPA. That's when I began to research how to actually calculate both your unweighted and weighted GPAs. But any time I wanted to calculate my GPA, I had to actually pull out a calculator and perform the mathematical operations which was pretty tiring. I wanted to streamline this process, for not just myself but also for other students just like me, hence I created EasyGPA!\n\nHow I made EasyGPA: I made EasyGPA using mainly HTML, although CSS was used for styling the UI, and JavaScript was responsible for the actual calculations and input generation.\n\nWhat I struggled with and learned along the way: One of the things I struggled with was making sure the GPA calculations were accurate, especially with the weighted GPA calculator which takes 3 different factors into account. Also, I was having some spacing issues as there was a huge gap between the EasyGPA header and the unweighted GPA calculator which looked pretty ugly in terms of the UI. Something I learned about along the way was how to handle user input effectively in JavaScript and just overall web-app styling.\nREAD: How AI was used: I originally had the GPA calculator code in Python as it was made for an AP CSP project, but to integrate the calculator into a web-app I needed it to be in JavaScript. That's where AI came in to help me convert code from Python --> JavaScript for an easy web-app integration!	300	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTYzOTYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--bb058f75ec3d2053253fe513e6bc14db5b89b327/2025_07_04_0qa_Kleki.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://easygpatool.vercel.app/	2025-07-02 05:19:27.599	2025-07-04 22:46:31.114	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DogCosmo/EasyGPA/main/README.md	https://github.com/DogCosmo/EasyGPA	U092KBJMA7L	2025-07-10 11:57:01.252

The application will also display an expected schedule of each day of the week (Monday through Sunday) and the expected number of students to attend each time slot. It will also display summary data sheets.

3951	Fluid Simulator	Lindamust	/projects/5696	Not sure how far I'll take this. I plan on making a simple fluid dynamics simulation with just a velocity field (how the particles should move) and density field (distribution of mass). If I can make something that works I might try to optimse and maybe re-write in C++ for further optimisations.\n\nI have a decent bit of experience in physics simulations, making things like particle collision simulations with nearly 1000 particles (heavy use of optimisation tech), so now I want to move onto fluid dynamics.\n\nThe math is going to very complicated, so I'm not sure how far I'll get. I'll be using any resource I can get my hands on. I am definitely using AI to explain the more complicated parts of the Euler equations for fluid dynamics and other youtube videos.	2	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-07 11:58:06.913	2025-07-07 11:58:06.913			U0950KU56JD	2025-07-10 11:58:59.614

3762	Achernar	Ibrahim Shahid	/projects/377	Achernar is a modular, AI-powered astronomy platform designed for real-time imaging, smart guidance, and field reliability—running entirely offline if needed. At its core is the Achernar Daemon, a headless service written in Rust and C++ that runs on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson, or field laptops. This daemon handles camera interfacing (via V4L2 or ASI SDK), real-time frame capture, debayering, and hardware encoding, with integrated ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for on-device inference. It runs a local REST API (via actix-web or warp) to expose control interfaces.\n\nThe AI layer performs offline inference to suggest focus, exposure, and filter settings based on local environmental conditions, using quantized ONNX models that are confidence-based and never enforced. Imaging sessions are organized in a local-first folder structure, saving FITS files, logs, and preview videos, with append-only JSON logs and optional SQLite used for dashboard caching. When internet becomes available, sessions can be automatically synced to S3, Google Drive, or Dropbox via rclone or custom Rust logic.\n\nUsers interact through either a WebApp PWA, designed with React or SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS, or a Desktop App for advanced control. The WebApp is served from the edge device over a local Wi-Fi hotspot, enabling users to preview live streams (MJPEG or WebRTC), pick targets, and start imaging directly from their phone or tablet. The Desktop App—built using Qt or Tauri—caters to professionals with tools for FITS inspection, focus metric plotting, and full mount control (via INDI or ASCOM). All user sessions are secure, crash-safe, and never rely on cloud services for imaging, making Achernar robust for remote or off-grid astronomy. Cloud sync and remote dashboards activate only post-session, ensuring reliability with WebSockets for control and WebRTC tunnels for live previews, hosted optionally via Next.js or SvelteKit on platforms like Vercel.\n\nAlso, beacause im like activley working on this, i only have the github, im working on the readme and the demo link tho, i want to get an mvp done by like julys end	21	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTI3MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1408b81c730e921a8a7fa8a68f5967f523e76d4e/Screenshot%202025-06-22%20073416.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-16 23:38:54.158	2025-06-16 23:38:54.158		https://github.com/ibrahimshahid1/Achernar.tech	U07A1PR6XBP	2025-07-10 11:58:41.253

3515	🔋 WattUp – A Better Way to Track Your Battery	Kartikey	/projects/1642	Let’s be honest—the default battery stats in Windows are pretty useless. You get a percentage and maybe a rough time estimate if you're lucky. That’s where WattUp comes in.\n\nWattUp is a simple but powerful app that gives you actual insight into your laptop's battery. Whether you’re trying to figure out why your battery drains so fast or just want better info while charging, WattUp has your back.\nHere’s what it can do:\n\n    Track battery usage over time with clean, interactive graphs\n\n    Show your battery health, including wear level and original vs current capacity\n\n    Give you charging and discharging estimates based on real usage, not guesswork\n\n    Show detailed battery stats like cycle count, voltage, temperature, and more\n\n    Run quietly in the background without eating up your system resources\n\nIt’s everything the Windows battery meter should’ve been, but isn’t.\n\nIf you care about your battery and want better control over how your device uses power, WattUp makes it easy.	143	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7061b42df1170e7d249a9fa6ec2e6c8aef07681c/Screenshot%202025-06-19%20084201.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-19 03:25:15.822	2025-06-19 03:25:15.822			U091SEHGETW	2025-07-10 11:58:17.382

3538	Minecraft Plugin that adds combat moves and NPC behaviour	AndyNoob	/projects/1497	Last summer, I had wanted to add some more attacks to Minecraft: wide arcing attacks that utilize camera movement. \n\nAdditionally, I also hooked the new combat into the Sentinel plugin. However, in practice, the NPC behavior in Sentinel is less than ideal. The NPCs does not know how to strafe or dodge incoming attacks. They are especially defenseless against maces, usually standing still to be hit by them. \n\nTherefore, I wanted to make my own combat behavior that hopefully solves these issues.	438	1	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-18 20:30:19.932	2025-06-18 20:30:19.932	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndyNoob/combat/main/README.md	https://github.com/AndyNoob/combat	U07A64GBPV1	2025-07-10 11:58:19.319

4172	Weather onchain logger	Student	/projects/4782	WeatherChain Logger is a hackathon project that brings real-time weather information onto the blockchain. Users can fetch live weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) for any location via the OpenWeatherMap API and record it on-chain through a Solidity smart contract. This creates an immutable, tamper-proof log of weather data that anyone can verify.\n\nThe frontend is built with React – a JavaScript library for building user interfaces – providing an intuitive web app. Under the hood, we use Hardhat (an Ethereum development environment) to compile and deploy the Solidity contract. Users connect with their MetaMask crypto wallet to authenticate and send transactions.\n\nIn summary, WeatherChain Logger offers a simple interface to log weather conditions on Ethereum, ensuring data transparency and persistence.	0	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-01 17:40:06.935	2025-07-01 17:40:06.935			U093UJ6S3AL	2025-07-10 11:59:22.09

The mod has almost full customization of all its features using the game's built in traits and world laws system, allowing you to disable orientations, intimacy, etc!\n\nThis was made in C# using the NeoModLoader and Harmony to help modify the game.	2799	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Video Game	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-18 20:59:23.574	2025-07-02 22:38:46.603	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MianReplicate/Topic-of-Love/master/README.md	https://github.com/MianReplicate/Topic-of-Love	U08TRV8L5MJ	2025-07-10 12:00:24.136

5023	Fox Thoughts	Afrizal Yafi'	/projects/702	Fox Vents is a minimalist, anonymous web app for private venting — built as a digital space where I (Fox) can drop thoughts, feelings, or memories without judgment.\n\nIt’s made using Next.js (App Router) + React + shadcnui + TailwindCSS, with Firebase for data and Cloudinary for media uploads. The viewer site is public and read-only, while the dashboard is protected and made just for me.\n\nWhat makes it special is the intention — it’s not for likes, follows, or comments. It’s just crumbs. Quietly placed.

3427	Shake Alert	Gaurav Singh	/projects/2117	Real-Time Earthquake Detector & Disaster Response Demo\nThis repository is a demo web application for real-time earthquake detection and disaster response, leveraging the power of crowdsourced sensor data, mapping, and robust communication features. The application is built primarily with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses Firebase for backend services.\n\nKey Features\nEarthquake Detection via Phone Sensors:\nUtilizes the phone's accelerometer to detect significant shaking. When multiple nearby devices register similar patterns, an earthquake is confirmed and real-time alerts are sent out.\n\nCrowd Confirmation:\nEarthquake events are validated using data from surrounding users’ devices, ensuring high accuracy and reducing false alarms.\n\nDisaster Heatmap (Snapchat-style):\nUsers can post photos and videos from affected areas. These are aggregated and displayed as a heatmap on Google Maps, visually representing disaster intensity and scope.\n\nInteractive Map with Profile Markers:\n\nWhen zoomed in, user locations are shown as their profile pictures on the map.\nHovering or clicking a marker opens a popup with user details (name, status, contact info, etc.).\nMarker clustering for low zoom levels, expanding into individual profiles as you zoom closer.\nReal-Time Location & Alerts:\nThe app continuously shares and updates user locations for efficient disaster response and coordination.\n\nOffline Chat & Satellite Connectivity:\nSupports offline messaging and satellite communication features (targeted for Android 15), ensuring connectivity even during network outages.\n\nUser Authentication:\nSecure login, signup, and session management for all users.\n\nFirebase Integration:\nHandles authentication, real-time data updates, and backend logic.	213	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzE5OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b79ea88a05d1fdefe1746fd54db8801ef9f1c9ed/ChatGPT%20Image%20Jun%2020,%202025,%2005_06_25%20PM.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://www.detectordemo.vercel.app	2025-06-20 11:16:40.326	2025-07-10 05:31:25.952	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohit29032005/detectordemo/master/README.md	https://github.com/rohit29032005/detectordemo	U091SERQSLS	2025-07-10 11:58:07.288

100	SIVRAJ	Pranav N	/projects/479	Its kinda been my dream to create something that acts like JARVIS from Iron Man (although obviously not as advanced). The goal of this project is to make sort of a personal AI helper that goes beyond a chatbot. Its meant to be used by people with multiple screens in my vision, where your workflow happens on one of those screens and SIVRAJ works on the other one helping you out with whatever you're doing. For example, you could be coding and it would automatically pick up on what you're doing and pull up the documentation for your language with no instruction. Or you could verbally tell it what you're trying to do, like play a game or act as an autoclicker etc, and it would do that. I probably won't actually be able to make this in this summer even with hundreds of hours spent, but  I will try my best.	1983	16	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6d1b6b03e25448a4d259df3a60f19cdaf3462159/Screenshot%202025-06-18%20131110.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-17 03:09:38.333	2025-06-28 04:13:45.317			U092DAC5A5N	2025-07-10 11:52:31.993

First of its kind, there are no restrictions to what this AI hybrid can do—it’s built to do it all. Sentient can send traffic and imitate real human traffic, find vulnerabilities in websites and help you fix them, track emails and usernames across platforms, and edit, analyze, and understand files and their contents to ensure safety or improve them. It can copy entire websites to demonstrate phishing attacks, reverse engineer malware and viruses, decrypt and encrypt passwords and keys, and perform Google dorking for advanced search and OSINT.\n\nSentient now also features PDF and image analysis, password and breach checks, GeoIP and reverse IP lookups, Shodan and VirusTotal integration, username checks, packet capture and analysis, subdomain takeover detection, CVE search, JWT decoding, URL expansion, and file type identification—making it a much more comprehensive cybersecurity assistant. It supports phone number, email, and domain lookups (including WHOIS, DNS, and subdomains), port scanning, directory brute-forcing, SSL/TLS security checks, log file analysis, and exporting detailed reports. Sentient can auto-update itself, generate and analyze hashes, crack passwords, extract and analyze metadata, integrate with threat intelligence feeds, generate custom wordlists, schedule scans, integrate with Slack/Discord/webhooks, scan files with YARA rules, provide AI-powered remediation suggestions, support user-created plugins, and generate detailed PDF/HTML reports.\n\nWhile Sentient uses the Gemini API as its base for conversational AI, it extends and overlaps this capability by giving the AI direct access to powerful cybersecurity, automation, and OSINT modules—enabling it to not just chat, but to act, analyze, and automate complex security tasks far beyond standard AI assistants. Sentient is your all-in-one AI cybersecurity and automation toolkit—constantly evolving to meet new threats and challenges.	1981	14	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDYxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--60636349a01d9a916ee36e444170f328a6646cf7/Screenshot%202025-06-21%20084155.png	Command Line Tool	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://pypi.org/project/sentient-ai/	2025-06-20 17:38:33.873	2025-07-03 13:28:18.848	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x0as/Sentient-Project/main/README.md	https://github.com/x0as/Sentient-Project	U091D7V5ZN3	2025-07-10 11:52:35.536

It scans food and gives it a smart, simple score called the “Vish Score.”\n\nUnlike other apps that only count calories or list nutrition facts, Fooda looks at three things together:\n\nTaste — How delicious the food is.\n\nNutrition — How healthy it is for your body.\n\nUser Opinions — What people think after trying it.\n\nBy combining all of this, Fooda gives one powerful score to help people know if a food is truly good — not just healthy, but tasty and trusted by others too.\n\nIt’s completely free, built with love and learning, and designed to help people eat better, feel better, and share better food with the world. And best of all, it’s built by an 8-year-old who believes technology should help people — not just make money.	3605	10	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTI5MzIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--66b29a598b3a2f6124ceb155b66266ddf4e2ed41/Screenshot%202025-06-21%20223604.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://idyllic-piroshki-341e14.netlify.app/	2025-06-21 23:30:45.934	2025-07-10 09:18:36.96	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrishankjoshi/fooda.site/main/README.md	https://github.com/vrishankjoshi/fooda.site	U091QF9R4EP	2025-07-10 11:52:50.024
378	GenjutsuEdit	Nahom Beletew	/projects/5064	GenjutsuEdit is a robust, feature rich web application for editing photos that was created using TypeScript and React and provides a beautiful anime inspired experience. With a 3D Sharingan animation on the landing page and a special loading screen where a 3-tomoe Sharingan transforms into the Mangekyō, the user interface is exquisitely designed. Users can upload one image to gain access to tools such as photo editor where users can crop the photo, rotate the photo, flip the photo and add text to the photo, dynamic visual effects by adjusting the contrast and other image elements, an elastic photo tool with symmetry support for artistic warping, and a cartoon converter for different cartoon style changes. Along with supporting pre installed music like Blue Bird,centuries and royalty , the app lets users add their own music, which blends seamlessly across all pages. With capabilities like Uchiha Text Mode which changes every text in everypage into uchiha terminologies if turned on, dark/light mode, fast upload, intelligent error handling which is useful when users forget to upload an image, and a profile section that shows my name and social links.  All these features are very helpfull for a better user experience and engagement.	1991	8	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTc2MTYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--44b9f8b626df1397d8e099eaa1fa849f1eb84841/BannerImage.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://genjutsuedit.netlify.app	2025-07-03 06:32:39.272	2025-07-08 16:11:46.982	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nahom-cyber-coder/GenjutsuEdit/refs/heads/main/README.md	https://github.com/Nahom-cyber-coder/GenjutsuEdit	U0865AM2PGV	2025-07-10 11:53:00.701

Between packed class schedules and the pressure to perform academically, opportunities to meet like-minded peers are often limited. Traditional social platforms aren't designed to facilitate the kinds of friendships that make school and college rewarding.\n\nMy Solution:\nCampusConnect is a specialized platform designed exclusively for college students to discover meaningful friendships. By focusing on shared academic interests, extracurricular activities and personal values, we help students cut through the noise of generic social networks.\n\nImpact and Vision:\nCampusConnect represents a new approach to student socialization - one that values quality connections over quantity. By focusing on the unique aspects of college and school life and the natural connections that exist within academic communities, we're helping students build the kinds of relationships that define the school and college experience.	94	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjE0OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--11a3c77bc135a46edddec8ac62d58e8e716b2d5f/Screenshot%202025-06-18%20215503.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-19 01:10:06.536	2025-06-19 01:47:25.819			U083DD9RMG9	2025-07-10 11:58:17.645

3529	BKFZ SubGHz	Brian Walczak	/projects/1555	Welcome! My project is called BKFZ SubGHz (stands for Brian's Knockoff Flipper Zero, lol), a custom-built ESP32 device that can scan, record, and replay SubGHz radio signals, kind of like a DIY version of the Flipper Zero!\n<br>\nI built this last October after getting curious about how the Flipper Zero works, and wanted to recreate part of its functionality using cheap AliExpress parts. What started as a small side project I worked on when I was free quickly turned into one of the most challenging projects I’ve ever made. \n<br>\nThe project is powered by an ESP32 (a Wi-Fi microcontroller that runs all the code) which serves a web interface you can access from your phone. The microcontroller is connected to a CC1101 transceiver, which is a chip capable of capturing and replaying SubGHz frequencies like 433 MHz (the Flipper Zero uses this exact same chip from Texas Instruments).\n<br>\nThe entire thing is held together by a custom PCB designed in KiCad to keep it small, and it has added support for .sub files from real Flipper Zeros (so it’s compatible with public files from the flipper community). I also added support for preset modulation to match the Flipper Zero's configuration!\n<br>\nFeatures:\n- Frequency Analyzer: Scan and analyze nearby devices and their frequencies with ease.\n- Record RAW: Capture and record nearby signals with precise RSSI configuration.\n- Replay RAW: Replay previously captured signals from a file (no SD card required).\n- Preset Configuration: Configure the frequency of your device, and set the preset modulation (just like the Flipper Zero!).\n- Flipper Zero Support: Effortlessly replay any Flipper Zero SUB file, including the many publicly available ones, whenever you need.\n<br><br>\nThe following parts were used for the project (~$18.01 total, but you can make a minimal USB-powered one for ~$4.98)\n<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/refs/heads/main/Other/Assembly%20Photos/Components/All%20Components.jpeg" />	8	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjA0NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7276779fe4581c24bfa9e4466a96773dcfe628b6/Step%208.%20Final%20Product.jpeg	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz	2025-06-18 22:27:05.593	2025-06-27 05:45:32.221	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz/main/README.md	https://github.com/BrianWalczak/BKFZ-SubGHz	U091MEESEDT	2025-07-10 11:58:17.79

I used Python to write scripts that helped control what was shown, when it was shown, and also to manage updates automatically.\n\nAlong with that, I also worked on automation tasks using both Python and PHP. This involved writing small programs or scripts that did repeated jobs by themselves, like moving files, sending data between systems, or updating information on websites without needing to do it manually each time.

By looking at where the ball is and how big it looks in the video, the system can tell how far the ball is from the dog.\n\nclick here to access replit if demo does not work (the demo is just a simple project that shows the basics how the ball is being detected): https://replit.com/@IshaanAhuja-algebros314/BallDetectionDemo#templates/index.html	3752	9	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMwNTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--94674d4710516467961748d2e26af40e3df5e3bb/Screenshot%202025-06-30%20at%205.27.23%E2%80%AFPM.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://e80506ea-3d94-4a14-a40a-12a907c13919-00-1xmqvxim85dfm.worf.replit.dev/	2025-06-21 01:26:01.359	2025-07-01 04:17:15.666	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishaan-ahuja/RobotDogFetch/refs/heads/main/README.md	https://github.com/ishaan-ahuja/RobotDogFetch/tree/main	U07AQAW3REH	2025-07-10 11:52:58.052

If you faced any problems with the link of the bot on the website, just open the Telegram app or website and go to the @saifurl_bot user, which is my bot.\n\nDescription:\nIt's now just a telegram bot that depends on your API key for testing. You could use this public shared API key (for testing cases only) (run /justtest on the bot to get it too):\ne15ce2a23e54a4a9c24a93796feb7ad20cc334357269b0f7732ab1c526e7e9d4\nHowever, if you want to get your own, you should go to the main site at urls.saifdev.xyz and create an account, then verify your account from the profile page, and go to the developer page and ask for your apikey\n\nThe available commands:\n/start - Start the bot and register\n/menu - Show main menu\n/apikey - Manage your API keys\n/shorturl - Manage short URLs\n/urls - Alias for the shorturl command\n/setdomain - Set your preferred domain\n/help - Show help information\n/contact - Contact information\n/about - About this bot\n/todo - Setup guide for new users\n/justtest - Get test API key (SoM/Converge only)\n/ping - Test bot responsiveness\n\n\nStory behind the project:\nFrom the beginning of the summer vacation and I wanted to learn to build bots, especially for Telegram, since I felt that would be funny and even useful for me and my built services in the future. However, there wasn't any idea or encouragement to learn to do so soon, since I am working on other projects and wanted to complete the first. Until I found the Converge YSWS program, which is at http://converge.hackclub.com. This program is a program where you submit a bot for any platform and get prizes like any YSWS program. That was like the spark that made me start this project, and I am happy now. \nThere are plans to create more bots for my short URL service, but I think I should complete my other projects first. \n\nI used AI in:\nI was using GitHub Copilot in VS Code. Copilot helped me with its code completion feature in saving time, and it also created the readme file for me. I was asking him if I failed in any problems, and writing commit messages, and some of the devlog descriptions.

By comparing the submitted text to the AI-generated output, it evaluates how closely the ideas align. A high similarity in ideas between the two texts indicates a greater likelihood that the submitted text was AI generated. This is in comparison to other AI detectors, which often focus on writing style.	74	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-05 16:57:32.434	2025-07-05 16:57:32.434		https://github.com/derek-pohl/AI-Detection-Through-Association	U091HCS1GN7	2025-07-10 11:59:05.1

3638	cityBike	comba	/projects/1035	The CityBike project is a management system for bike rentals in a city. It allows for loading customer and bike information from files, simulating reservations for electric and mechanical bikes, and calculating the costs associated with each customer. Customers can make reservations for mechanical bikes, which have no cost, or electric bikes, which have a base cost with discounts depending on their type (YOUNG or SENIOR). The system simulates 100 reservations for each day in June 2025, randomly assigning bikes to customers. At the end, the system calculates the total cost of each customer's reservations and determines who has the highest accumulated cost.\n\nThe code is structured into several classes, such as CityBike, Cliente, Bicicleta, Estacion, and Reserva, with key methods that allow loading data from binary and CSV files, simulating reservations, and calculating the associated costs. The system also handles possible errors in input data and ensures that bikes and stations are managed correctly. Information about customers, reservations, and costs is presented clearly and concisely, and the customer with the highest cost is easily identified, providing a clear view of the system's usage and costs.\n\nI programmed this in Spanish because it is my native language and the one I feel most comfortable with.	136	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTkzLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--420df1952a48feeb711e3e718a2d5d5f3307a10b/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202025-06-17%20201207.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-17 18:07:04.21	2025-07-02 22:51:14.276	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alainGit-stack/cityBike/main/README.md	https://github.com/alainGit-stack	U092D0ZPA8Y	2025-07-10 11:58:29.48

712	MindPilot	Zsombor Kukucska	/projects/1487	MindPilot is an AI-powered productivity and learning assistant designed to help users stay focused and understand any topic more effectively.\nAs a technical high school student preparing for final exams, I often face two major problems: it's hard to stay concentrated for long periods, and it's even harder to understand difficult topics quickly and deeply. MindPilot was born from this personal frustration, a tool that combines a smart focus assistant with an intelligent tutor, all in a lightweight and accessible web app.\n\nMindPilot allows you to start distraction-free focus sessions using a timer-based system while keeping track of your progress. But what makes it unique is the ability to ask any question or type any topic, and the built-in AI (powered by Cohere’s Command R+ model) explains it in a clear and understandable way. Whether you're struggling with a math concept, a programming topic, or even a piece of history, MindPilot is here to help.\n\nThe project is built using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. It connects to the Cohere API to generate explanations in real time. A .env system is used to keep API keys safe, and the frontend and backend communicate through REST endpoints.\n\nThroughout the Summer of Making, I plan to extend MindPilot with new features such as:\n\nA personal progress dashboard\nSupport for multiple subjects and languages\nEnhanced session analytics\nAnd eventually, a mobile app version\nThe goal is to turn MindPilot into something that doesn't just help me but could help any student, self-learner, or curious mind around the world. It’s more than a study tool. It’s a digital co-pilot for your brain.	352	6	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzkwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--53f30d12da16a5170869fc7b410c594959e51c1a/Screenshot%202025-06-24%20at%2021.46.22.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-18 20:13:52.618	2025-06-18 20:51:31.531	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Frezzard2/MindPilot/main/README.md	https://github.com/Frezzard2/MindPilot	U08S0LWH27P	2025-07-10 11:53:35.248

Users can search for satellites, visualize their positions, and potentially highlight or track them in real-time.	302	6	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTUxNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--845f28954f1aeb626f999a0bfc4b55520a25ad10/CELESTIALITE.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://celestialite.vercel.app/	2025-06-20 05:22:15.352	2025-07-10 03:56:32.866	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harshDhiman3344/Celestialite/main/README.md	https://github.com/harshDhiman3344/Celestialite	U091ZLP5ZHB	2025-07-10 11:53:33.646

By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence and natural language processing, MindScribe transforms the traditionally time-consuming task of clinical note-taking into an efficient, automated process.\n\nThe platform addresses a critical pain point in mental health practice: the administrative burden that prevents therapists from focusing entirely on their clients.

Additionally, the system provides robust multilingual support, including Urdu-to-text transcription capabilities, ensuring accessibility for diverse client populations.\n\nThis comprehensive solution empowers mental health professionals to dedicate more time to patient care while maintaining detailed, accurate clinical records that support continuity of care and treatment planning.	380	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	\N	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-09 08:53:02.629	2025-07-09 08:53:02.629	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aun-shahid/TherapEase/main/README.md	https://github.com/Aun-shahid/TherapEase	U092S6WDM26	2025-07-10 11:58:53.251

3656	Multi-Region Disaster Recovery	Rhys Pounder	/projects/950	This project, which originated from my university studies, is now a complete, automated disaster recovery system for AWS.\n\nUsing Terraform, I built a multi-region infrastructure with a primary EC2 instance and a backup instance in a separate region. The system automatically detects when the primary instance fails using CloudWatch Alarms. This triggers a notification via SNS and SQS, which a Python script on my home server receives. The script then instantly starts the backup EC2 instance to take over.\n\nTo monitor the system, I also developed a web dashboard using React and Flask that shows the real-time status and metrics of both instances.	72	1	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-17 16:11:08.641	2025-06-17 16:29:42.957	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bokkieboy/Disaster-Recovery-Dashboard/refs/heads/main/readme.md	https://github.com/Bokkieboy/Disaster-Recovery-Dashboard	U0923NJMNTB	2025-07-10 11:58:31.341

These dictionaries contain collections of words and how often they occur with each other which can be used to predict words. Some notable examples include autocorrect and predictive text. Although they don't "think" for themselves, they serve as tools for finding relationships in the words we use in our daily life. I have decided to work on these simple language models in order to learn more about them and other tools I use.	2026	12	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTYxMzUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--9df999f3219ab4977cea632092f7fe90a04a8b08/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20at%206.44.07%E2%80%AFPM.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://ngram.vercel.app	2025-06-25 10:31:13.915	2025-07-07 14:02:30.081	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlassyBridge/Ngram/main/README.md	https://github.com/GlassyBridge/Ngram/tree/main	U080V8UG5BR	2025-07-10 11:52:40.156

303	Table Tennis Ranking Web App	M-Mrk	/projects/75	Ever realized how little your table tennis players actually play table tennis in normal training? Well isnt that a shame? Especially since you learn alot playing in a competitive setting!\n\nThis is a ranking list which aims to encourage competitive play. It achieves this by giving all players a unique ranking starting from 1 and going on. Their goal is to get to the top by the end of the season. You can move one ranking up when you challenge a player above you and win against them. The app will provide a viewing/player mode and a trainer moder, in which active matches will be started and configured. The viewing mode will also feature stats of the players to encourage improvement.\n\nIt is based on flask and bootstrap.\n\nWhen the project is finished I want this to be an accesible tool which everyone can use if they can host it themselves.\n\n#AI helped me create this (mainly just the frontend) as I am not a huge fan of developing the front end#	2349	10	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTg1NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--97b0af31ed3539816b1b73715723a89e526b175c/Screenshot%202025-06-26%20215935.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-16 16:16:38.395	2025-06-16 16:18:55.61			U091M3J5R9T	2025-07-10 11:52:53.941

470	Timer Bot	Brian Walczak	/projects/419	Welcome! My project features a bot for Discord communities to create detailed timers, alarms, and reminders in their Discord server. This project is very special to me because it was actually my very first coding project back in 2020! A project so small also happened to be the project that helped me discover my true passion for coding, and helped me start my journey with Node.js development. For years now, Discord has lacked a native way to create timers, alarms, and reminders in Discord servers (a rather simple feature that many large communities have asked for). This bot is my attempt to finally solve that problem once and for all!\n<br>\nI started developing this bot back in middle school, but over time, it became too overwhelming with the constant changes to Discord's API. With factors outside of my reach like rising server costs and busy study nights throughout the week, I eventually decided to shut down the project. Well, my goal this week is to try and bring it back to life, and rebuild the entire thing from the ground up!\n<br>\nI'll be honest, being my first ever coding project, Timer Bot was definitely the sloppiest code I've ever written (nowhere near being production-ready). So I figured why not spend this Summer rewriting the entire thing from scratch. I recently picked up some new equipment to help keep my personal projects running (like websites and Immich servers), so this is my attempt of reviving it and giving it another life :)\n<br>\nFeatures:\n- (⏱️) Create precise timer countdowns with hours, minutes, and seconds.\n- (⏰) Schedule alerts for specific dates and times in your local time zone.\n- (📝) Add titles and descriptions to your alarms to be notified of your upcoming events, goals, and more!\n- (💾) Save timer configurations with custom names for quick access anytime.\n- (📋) Manage all your running timers, alarms, and reminders in one place.\n- (🌐) Set your local time zone for accurate alarm scheduling.\n- (🔔) Choose users or roles to notify when an event ends.	699	8	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f8392b3d9592ebdafe8834a2e156b22adaafd4e1/Screenshot%202025-06-18%20223333.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=759432068651548705&permissions=277025614848&scope=bot	2025-06-17 00:55:33.21	2025-07-09 19:43:08.586	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/TimerBot/main/README.md	https://github.com/BrianWalczak/TimerBot	U091MEESEDT	2025-07-10 11:53:11.233

559	ImposterGame with AI	Janosch Dickhage	/projects/1930	Hello everyone o/\nHere in Germany, at the moment, the Impostor game is a really huge trend.\n\nIn short: The Impostor game is a game where you and your friends get together. Everyone receives a secret word except for the Impostor. Now, everyone has to say a word. The crewmates have to say a word which tells the other crewmates that they themselves are not the Impostor, and the Impostor tries to mislead them into thinking that person isn't the Impostor. After a few rounds, everyone votes for one player they think is the Impostor. If they get it right, they win; if not, the Impostor wins.\n\nExample: The word is beach\n\nCrewmate1 says: Cocktail (because of beach bar and such things)\nCrewmate2 says: Castle (because of building a sandcastle)\nImpostor1 says: Sun ( because the Imposter understood that the word may be sth about vacation/beach or sth like that)\n\nCurrently, many students, like myself, are playing at school in free time and, for example, in breaks.\n\nThere are many apps being used, but I thought about the people who don't have many friends to play with because there maybe want to play the game too but cant ( xD )  . That's why I want to work on an app where you can play it yourself with AI friends.\n\nI know it sounds like a troll project, and yeah, it was a random thought I had at school, but I kind of liked it. That's why I am programming it.\n\nMy goal is to make an Android & iOS compatible app where you can just play the Impostor game with a few AI Agents.\n\nI also chose this project because normally I mainly write Python or Java backend code, and I want to challenge myself to program some React Native.	698	7	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE0MjMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--7ebce1ec56eeb737fe94366699433e0c6500d36d/1ffff410-2fd4-4799-aa08-8187d6175dd0.png	Mobile App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-19 20:29:09.005	2025-06-28 22:22:33.369	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockplacer4/ImposterGameWithAI/main/README.md	https://github.com/blockplacer4/ImposterGameWithAI	U091Q6XL5R8	2025-07-10 11:53:19.782

588	SaifURLs	Saif Abdelrazek	/projects/379	This is a short URL service that I have built using ReactJS and React Router for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend. The App contains login pages and a Dashboard that show the user short URLs and allows the user to create, edit, and delete short URLs. In addition, it includes a profile for the user to manage their account. Furthermore, it includes a developer page to let anyone access their short URLs using their API key and edit them. Github Copilot helped in this project with the styling and in the Readme writing. BTW, this is my first real full-stack project and first time to use React that way, and I am happy about that.\nThe repo URL shows the frontend and the backend at [SaifAPI](https://github.com/saifabdelrazek011/saifapi) (they don't support markdown, I think) (&-&)\n\n\nYou could test the website with summer.test@urls.saifdev.xyz (verified email) and summer.test3@urls.saifdev.xyz (unverified email), and summer.test5@urls.saifdev.xyz (according to my laziness) or create your own. Try all with the password Test@summer3.

It contains two things: what we'll call the client, which receives information from each server and displays it on a web interface, and what we'll call the server, which retrieves all the information and sends it to the client.\n\n\nThe server will be developed in Go in order to offer a light solution to install, and will send the information from the server in a specific TCP message format. The client will be developed in TypeScript and will contain two main parts: the translator, which will translate the TCP messages into readable format and store them in a database, and the display, which will read the database and display the data.	897	6	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg5NjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--1e2762af1795af15820290b0af97eea5092a28b5/Frame%201.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-05 02:06:16.418	2025-07-06 00:17:27.645			U091NMYE7A9	2025-07-10 11:53:25.337

869	PrimeVector - new fast algorithm for GCD and LCM	xCuzImVInni	/projects/2895	I’m building a high-performance arithmetic system in Rust that rethinks number representation. By encoding integers as prime exponent vectors, it converts:\nMultiplication → Vector addition\nGCD/LCM → Min/Max operations\nMatrix math → Optimized vector transforms\nThe core innovation exploits prime factorization’s mathematical properties. Modern hardware outperforms this approach for general cases of multiplication due to extreme optimization of traditional arithmetic. The key bottleneck is factorization latency (why RSA works). Today, it’s not viable for multiplication, but one can easily figure out the most efficient cases for it and combine the binary GCD algorithm with the PFS (Prime Factor System) algorithm and then we get an optimized version of the binary GCD and LCM algorithms (the second one is heavily based on GCD).\nFuture quantum integration could revolutionize multiplication too:\nShor’s algorithm would enable efficient factorization\nPractical for huge numbers (n > 2^25 bits based on my calculations)\nTurns prime vectors into an universal accelerator for many operations	664	5	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTUzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--bf93ce9df1717c6d88703de45e0155c7897211ff/PrimeVector_Thumbnail.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://github.com/xCuzImVinni/Prime-Vectors/releases/tag/Algorithm	2025-06-22 15:43:09.224	2025-07-10 08:04:59.677	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xCuzImVinni/Prime-Vectors/main/README.md	https://github.com/xCuzImVinni/Prime-Vectors	U092HKP1D3L	2025-07-10 11:53:50.158

924	TideFly - Minecraft (temp) fly plugin	Kebluk	/projects/1500	TideFly is a Paper Minecraft plugin that enables server administrators to manage in-game flight effectively. Customize flight speeds, enable or disable flight based on player permissions, set flight duration limits, and provide daily flight time bonuses. Players can trade flight time if permitted, and data stored in a database ensures seamless functionality across your server network.\n\nThis project marks my first contribution to Hack Club's Summer of Making, my inaugural open-source project, and my first GitHub repository. I chose to begin with a familiar domain—Minecraft—to create something meaningful. Back in the day, I couldn’t find a temporary flight plugin for Minecraft that fully met my needs, so I decided to develop a custom solution tailored for both administrators and players.	1582	5	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzc3MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e81a43b4ab37ad97bf18673f7e8c625af7c73421/screencapture-github-Kebluk-SoF-2025-TideFly-2025-06-21-01_20_58.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-18 20:33:29.002	2025-07-09 18:49:41.014	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kebluk-SoM-2025/TideFly/refs/heads/main/README.md	https://github.com/Kebluk-SoM-2025/TideFly	U092EG8SULQ	2025-07-10 11:53:55.57

1070	KeyLayer	Nadeem Biryani Dealer	/projects/3889	KeyLayer v1.0\n"Turn your spare keyboard into a machine that does things so you don’t have to."\n\nThis is KeyLayer, a low-level macro tool for Windows HID devices. It’s not a key remapper. It’s not a hotkey thing. It’s more like: “What if this random keypad controlled your entire life?”\nBuilt for people who are either extremely efficient or extremely lazy (ideally both). I made this because I got tired of doing the same 6 actions 80 times a day and figured a dedicated macro keyboard deserved a bit more respect.\n\nFeatures (allegedly)\n\nDevice Isolation\nPick any HID keyboard and make it invisible to Windows. Now it only talks to KeyLayer. Like a walkie-talkie but way nerdier.\nVisual Macro Editor\nA drag-and-drop grid thing. You connect boxes. The boxes do things. Like a flowchart, if flowcharts had keypresses and HTTP requests.\nLayers\nMultiple keymaps per device. You can toggle them, hold them, or activate them conditionally. Basically like having 12 keyboards in one, but without the cable mess.\nAction Types\nIt simulates input, launches apps, takes screenshots, clicks stuff, types things, moves the mouse, yells at the OS, and maybe opens a file if you're lucky.\nTemplate System\nSave your macros. Share them. Never open your email with your actual hands again.\nImport/Export\nJSON, XML, AutoHotkey, PowerShell, or some compressed binary thing I half-documented.\nMacro Recorder\nPress record. Do a thing. Watch it get turned into a macro with weird timing values you'll have to clean up later.\nProfiles & Settings\nStored in JSON because YAML made me angry one time. Backup/restore works unless it doesn’t.\nStuff That Technically Works\n\nReal-time HID scanning\nMulti-device support\nLive testing in the macro editor\nNode zoom/pan so you can pretend it’s Blender\nUndo/Redo for when you mess up repeatedly\nTemplated macros with metadata nobody uses\nEncryption (for your deeply private macros)\nExample Use Cases\nGaming: Press one key to press three other keys. Wow.\nProductivity: Insert email templates so you don’t have to pretend to type anymore.\nDevelopment: Make a button that builds and runs your code because clicking things is exhausting.\nQA: Automate testing so your soul can remain intact.\n\nTroubleshooting\nDevice doesn’t show up? Plug it in better.\nIsolation fails? Probably another app being weird.\nNothing works? Try turning it off and on again.\nLaggy? Adjust some obscure buffer setting until it's less laggy.	425	4	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgwMTAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c3081c0ae2e28aa7b5cb17d96d71db3dbf6f1d16/image.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://github.com/UltimaCodes/KeyLayer/releases/tag/alphaMain	2025-06-26 10:26:43.684	2025-07-07 13:24:54.805	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UltimaCodes/KeyLayer/main/README.md	https://github.com/UltimaCodes/KeyLayer	U082WT6L2H2	2025-07-10 11:54:11.212

As an example - I am using this to make a Python - and specifically Python - coder model, that is specialized in the use of the AI coding tool Aider.\n\nIt supports paid models via a variety of providers e.g OpenAI, Claude, and free models via other providers like Chutes, OpenRouter, Groq, Targon, Google AI Studio, etc.\n\nIt supports retrieving logits as well, which allows for distillation (which is when a small AI model learns from a larger AI model, improving its performance.)\n\nAlso has qlora.py and distill.py scripts which are a 1 click method to train or distill a model on your data.	774	3	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkyMTYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a64cbe5780b45c53d949fc8c175896f4ae5218dc/Screenshot_2025-07-09-15-05-09-286_com.termux.jpg	\N	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://github.com/supastishn/synthetic-data-generator/blob/master/main.py	2025-07-09 12:00:44.852	2025-07-09 13:20:49.82	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supastishn/synthetic-data-generator/master/README.md	https://github.com/supastishn/synthetic-data-generator	U093108PGLC	2025-07-10 11:54:30.341

1713	chase game 	mandela ferede	/projects/5835	This project is an exciting, fast-paced chase game that puts players in a dynamic arena where quick thinking and sharp reflexes are key. In this game, you either escape from the opponent or chase them down — depending on the mode you choose. It’s built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed to give a smooth and interactive experience with both single-player and two-player options. The concept is simple, but the execution brings a level of creativity and detail that makes it stand out.\n\nWhat makes this game special is the set of features it packs into a browser-based experience. First, there are two main game modes: Player vs Computer (PVC) and Player vs Player (PVP). In PVC mode, the AI intelligently chases the player using a real-time pathfinding approach, creating tension as the player tries to survive. The PVP mode, on the other hand, adds a competitive edge where both players control their own characters — one with arrow keys, the other with WASD. This dual-mode setup makes the game replayable and engaging for different audiences.\n\nThe game arena itself is filled with obstacles that are randomly generated in each session. This means that no two matches are exactly alike, encouraging players to adapt their strategy every time. Power-ups appear throughout the arena, and collecting them temporarily increases a player's speed, adding a strategic layer to the chase. There’s also a win condition: in PVC mode, if the player survives for a set time, they win — adding a clear goal beyond just running away. The overall design is polished, with colorful gradients, glowing effects, and responsive layout adjustments that make it look and feel professional on any screen.\n\nThe reason I created this game is because I’ve always been a big fan of chase games and I’m passionate about game development. I want to build big, creative, and enjoyable games in the future, and this project is the beginning of that journey. Rather than diving straight into complex systems, I chose to start with a smaller project that still reflects my ideas and creativity. This Chase Game is a foundation — a first step in a series of projects I’m planning to build and ship as part of my personal learning and creative growth.\n\nMore exciting games are coming soon. Each one will explore new mechanics, stories, and fun ways to play. This is just the beginning, and I’m excited to continue developing games that not only work — but spark joy and imagination in the people who play them.	1823	3	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTk2NzcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--70861744d936854b22be82c9c7481d2046d500d6/Screenshot%202025-07-10%20033405.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-08 15:02:51.32	2025-07-09 21:48:34.627			U092JSPLANT	2025-07-10 11:54:31.984

My project features Bitwarden Auto-Backup Manager, a user-friendly application that creates local, encrypted auto-backups for your Bitwarden vault (without your master password).\n<br>\nFor the longest time now, Bitwarden (the password manager) has refused to implement backup functionality into their applications, more specifically the cloud-hosted solution. This left us users without an easy way to securely back up our vault data in the event of a server shutdown or other emergency. This Electronjs-based application fixes this very problem by providing reliable, automatic backups you control.\n<br>\nThe best part? Bitwarden Auto-Backup Manager is powered by the official Bitwarden clients library (found on GitHub) for backup file generation, as well as CryptoJS for PBKDF2 encryption/decryption methods, allowing you to decrypt your backups at any time! Your vault is synced with the help of the Bitwarden Desktop app (for credentials) and the Bitwarden API.\n<br>\nI built this application back in July of 2024, but I noticed that it lacks many expected features and nice-to-haves. Also, the code could definitely be much improved, which is why I decided to revamp this project during this Summer!	780	3	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ2NzAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--0cfded1805ba8ccfb5d095d3e352f05d10e8bc47/icon.png	Mobile App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://github.com/BrianWalczak/Bitwarden-Auto-Backup-Manager/releases	2025-07-02 05:25:30.163	2025-07-02 20:21:13.364	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianWalczak/Bitwarden-Auto-Backup-Manager/main/README.md	https://github.com/BrianWalczak/Bitwarden-Auto-Backup-Manager	U091MEESEDT	2025-07-10 11:54:38.499

1348	GeoPrimes - Geometric Interpretation of Prime Factorization of Numbers	xCuzImVInni	/projects/4710	This project visualizes natural numbers as geometric figures in a high-dimensional space defined by their prime factor exponents. Each prime number corresponds to an axis arranged radially in a circle, and a number's prime exponents determine its coordinates along these axes. Stacking these polygons vertically represents multiple numbers, creating a 3D prime-factor geometry. This novel visualization aids intuitive understanding of prime factorization structures and explores new geometric insights in number theory. It combines algebraic concepts with interactive 3D graphics for educational and research applications.	378	3	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU4OTAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4d9f1552cc04a4a1f9b5406c68048a4341885e7a/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-04%2011-39-51.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-01 11:14:44.84	2025-07-01 11:19:50.811	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xCuzImVinni/GeoPrimes/main/README.md	https://github.com/xCuzImVinni/GeoPrimes	U092HKP1D3L	2025-07-10 11:54:40.604

This will be saved to flash and work on startup after you configured it.\n\nTo be transparent: I use AI to generate Styles for the UI, to generate documentation texts (i am not good at writing stuff), to generate small code portions (copilot auto complete) and to understand error messages better,  but the logic and most of the code are written by me, Jorim.	772	3	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgzOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3c5c8a53b023596d677bcdf69f07afbbc8f4fb42/markup_1000010676%20(1).jpg	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-18 14:10:40.208	2025-07-02 22:38:45.181	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrmfrbg/modularMidiDriver/main/README.md	https://github.com/jrmfrbg/modularMidiDriver	U091HLS4Q0K	2025-07-10 11:55:05.631

Lost Control	/projects/978	We've all been there: trapped in a lecture so boring it feels like time is moving backward, and your notes end up being a messy scribble of words you can't even read later. \n \nWhat if you could just hit 'record' and get perfect, summarized, and super-smart notes delivered by AI?\n \nMeet NoteSpark, your personal AI note-taker! Our project is designed to automatically record those long lectures, listen to every word (so you don't have to), and instantly generate clean, organized, and intelligent notes. It will pick out the key points, define the tough stuff, and give you the ultimate study guide without you having to write a single word.\n \nWe're kicking things off with Slovak, but our mission is to break down language barriers for students everywhere, with more languages on the way. \n \nThis Summer of Making, we're building the ultimate cheat code for school.

1642	Cancer Screening Test	Alric Marvel	/projects/902	You’ve heard of medical screening bots — standard agents used by hospitals to turn away unnecessary patients. They're all surface-level. Generic symptom checkers with scripted flows that rarely understand real clinical pathways.\n\nWhat I built goes deeper.\n\nThis is an intelligent oncology triage system designed with clinical logic at its core. Instead of vague symptom matching, it uses structured decision pathways tailored to cancer screening protocols — streamlining the pre-diagnosis process with precision. It doesn’t just save time; it meaningfully reduces the load on oncologists by guiding patients toward the right tests, or away from unnecessary ones, before they ever enter the clinic. The system is built to simulate a structured pre-consultation, mirroring the logic a specialist would follow, but without taking up clinical time.\n\nThe AI agent follows a decision-tree logic model designed in alignment with oncology screening guidelines and based on the patient’s responses, it recommends appropriate screening tests (e.g. mammogram, colonoscopy, bloodwork) or flags the case for urgent follow-up.\n\nI'm not just building a prototype or a "student project". I'm developing a solution that is deployable in real-world environments, especially in clinics and hospitals where specialist access is limited.	1251	3	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzQyMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f4445734ad738589c0165d66f1b113f69ea4586a/devpost2.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://alricfv.github.io/Cancology.ai/	2025-06-17 14:55:05.381	2025-07-10 10:23:00.691	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alricfv/Cancology.ai/refs/heads/master/README.md	https://github.com/Alricfv/Cancology.ai	U091UJPPNKE	2025-07-10 11:55:09.253

1913	AP Study Tool	Aanya	/projects/4012	AP Study Tool is exactly as it sounds -- a tool to help each individual succeed on their AP exams! I was inspired to make this project, as this year when I was studying for my exams, I realized there are not many resources available online. All the resources I found were very boring, and I got distracted easily from them because they had a plain white UI. To solve this issue, AP Study Tool uses an aesthetic pink UI theme to ensure that students do not get distracted by a boring old UI when studying for their AP exams. The web app explains big ideas, includes helpful resources, and may even have an AI helper in the future! Although it doesn't have EVERY single AP exam on it, the website offers resources for the most popular AP exams available. Happy studying, and I hope AP Study Tool helps you ✨ slay ✨ your exams!	542	2	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTMwOTYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--5cdf84966b0cccc31a0c11e7973afc4de3755d6d/devlog.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://ap-study-tool.vercel.app/	2025-06-27 01:16:38.849	2025-07-03 01:21:29.285	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DogCosmo/AP-Study-Tool/refs/heads/main/README.md	https://github.com/DogCosmo/AP-Study-Tool	U092KBJMA7L	2025-07-10 11:55:39.136

1996	Okta Role Mining with OPA-Driven Access Recommendations	Arbind Mishra	/projects/3377	This project automates the process of role mining in Okta by integrating a LangGraph-based agent with GPT-powered group suggestion and Open Policy Agent (OPA) for access validation. The system analyzes user profiles, their current group memberships, and department data to intelligently recommend group assignments. It validates these recommendations against organizational policies enforced by OPA, ensuring compliant and optimized group assignments.\n\nThe solution includes:\n1. A React-based Frontend for user selection and result visualization.\n2. A FastAPI-based Backend to handle agent requests and serve the LangGraph engine.\n3. An Okta API Integration Layer for real-time user and group data retrieval.\n4. An OPA Policy Evaluation Layer to block non-compliant group assignments.\n5. Real-time logs for step-by-step traceability.\nThis project streamlines identity governance, enhances security posture, and provides an interactive interface for role analysis and decision-making.\n\nWrapper Layer: Orchestrating the System\nThe Wrapper Layer acts as the central orchestration engine that connects the frontend, backend, LangGraph agent, Okta APIs, and the OPA policy engine in a seamless flow. It provides a unified API interface that simplifies interactions across these distributed components.\n\nKey functions of the Wrapper Layer:\n1. Data Aggregation:\nCollects user and group information from the Okta API and serves it in a cleaned, frontend-friendly format.\n2. Process Invocation:\nSends user data to the LangGraph agent for group suggestion and orchestrates the complete flow from input selection to final decision.\n3. Response Routing:\nHandles asynchronous processing and real-time log streaming to the frontend, ensuring users can track every step of the decision process live.\n4. Abstraction:\nDecouples the complex backend logic from the React frontend, providing clean and minimal APIs for easy consumption.\n5. Modular Branches:\nSupports independent development and versioning of different components (agent, backend, frontend, OPA) by providing a consistent entry point.	274	2	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzMyOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--325027b761792e2e59bbe4419da68cfcc10dad65/detailed_flow_diagram.jpg	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hm8cBVmFnxON4KoEWT6lisTBQvBo0Gna/view?usp=sharing	2025-06-24 07:00:20.712	2025-07-02 22:56:03.048	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arbind007/OktaRoleMiningOpa/docs/README.md	https://github.com/Arbind007/OktaRoleMiningOpa	U092RTUP31Q	2025-07-10 11:55:47.105

2063	Filter	Karman Chhatwal	/projects/2927	Perhaps the simplest way to represent an image is with a grid of pixels (i.e., dots), each of which can be of a different color. For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white.\n\nIn this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply need more bits per pixel. A file format (like BMP, JPEG, or PNG) that supports “24-bit color” uses 24 bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)\n\nA 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel’s color, 8 bits to signify the amount of green in a pixel’s color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel’s color. If you’ve ever heard of RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.\n\nIf the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, 0xff, 0x00, and 0x00 in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as 0xff (otherwise known as 255 in decimal) implies “a lot of red,” while 0x00 and 0x00 imply “no green” and “no blue,” respectively. In this problem, you’ll manipulate these R, G, and B values of individual pixels, ultimately creating your very own image filters.\n\nIn a file called helpers.c in a folder called filter-less, write a program to apply filters to BMPs.\n\nThis is a problem from CS50x, Problem Set 4.	173	2	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTE4MzksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--585ed65c58490f85e66273e952ac89dd569e2b58/image.png	Command Line Tool	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-22 17:33:16.8	2025-07-02 22:38:52.846	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code50/120336831/main/filter-less/README.md	https://github.com/code50/120336831/tree/main/filter-less	U091PCWGNBX	2025-07-10 11:55:54.069

2137	PassKit	Devin	/projects/2274	PassKit is a modern, macOS-native GUI designed to simplify the process of bypassing Setup.app on legacy iOS devices. Built on top of LukeZGD’s open-source Legacy iOS Kit, PassKit brings a clean, user-friendly interface to a traditionally command-line-based workflow — no Terminal required. Just connect your device, click, and go.\n\nWhether you're restoring an old iPhone, experimenting, or simply want to bring a device back to life, PassKit streamlines the process with features like real-time logging, automatic device detection, and full Dark Mode support. Everything is fully integrated — no external configuration necessary.\n\nPassKit requires macOS 26.0 or later, Python 3, and libimobiledevice. It works best with devices running iOS 9 to 12. For advanced use cases, a jailbroken or rooted device is recommended.\n\nAn official installer, portable version, and Homebrew tap are in development. Released under the MIT license, PassKit welcomes contributions, suggestions, and community involvement.\n\nMade with care for tinkerers, enthusiasts, and tech minimalists.	436	2	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzUzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ee541e5874bb7b0306fafd15270a4d26f84648ef/Unbenannt-1.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-20 19:52:20.078	2025-07-02 00:14:39.385	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VelisCore/PassKit/main/README.md	https://github.com/VelisCore/PassKit	U09274QBNFM	2025-07-10 11:56:01.234

2636	TaskWave+, your academic assistant 	Anas Serag	/projects/5223	TaskWave+ is a productivity-focused web application that combines a Pomodoro Timer, a To-Do List, and a Dark Theme Toggle to help users manage time and tasks efficiently. Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in VS Code, the app features a clean, responsive interface with intuitive controls. The Pomodoro Timer follows the 25-minute work session model, allowing users to start, pause, and reset sessions to maintain focus and structure their workflow. The To-Do List enables users to add tasks with categories, priority levels, and scheduled times, all of which are saved in the browser using localStorage. A built-in alarm checks tasks every minute and alerts the user when it's time. Users can also mark tasks as done or delete them as needed. The Dark Mode toggle switches the theme by adding a CSS class to the body, improving visual comfort. The project was developed by first building the layout in HTML, styling it with CSS for modern visuals and responsive behavior, then coding all interactive features in JavaScript, including the timer logic, task handling, theme switching, and alarm system. TaskWave+ offers a practical, all-in-one tool for staying focused and organized.	376	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU2NjAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--7efdc52931d9ddc8deea064ce4029a1cb59488af/Screenshot%202025-07-04%20042215.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://annos-12oo1.github.io/taskwave/	2025-07-04 01:19:54.104	2025-07-04 04:04:19.991	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Annos-12oo1/taskwave/main/README.md	https://github.com/Annos-12oo1/taskwave	U094JKE5HU0	2025-07-10 11:56:50.929

2729	CrytsalEyes v1.0.0	Andrew Kim	/projects/4922	Did you know researchers are able to freeze organs through cryopreservation? That's right - with today's technology, scientists can preserve human tissue and organs at sufficiently low temperatures. The only problem is that when the organs are being thawed back, additional ice crystal growth - known as ice recrystallization - occurs, damaging the tissue. \n\nA number of researchers are trying to develop ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) technologies. The purpose of the CyrstalEyes software is to aid their efforts by providing a tool that measures the size and density of ice crystals. Determining the efficacy of IRI antifreeze proteins requires analyzing the shape and size of microscopic ice growth, which, through traditional analysis, requires hours of manual labor. Imagine drawing thousands of contours with your hand. That's what my mentor first had to do, but as her intern, I developed this software that can automatically extract features from microscope images. \n\nI'm using Python and a machine learning library called Cellpose to create my app. Feel free to try it out! (It's still in beta though.)	1064	1	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQzMjQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--0f78d9bfcac13c14c9064870daf44634af567ca5/splash.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://github.com/i30101/CrystalEyes-v1.0.0.git	2025-07-02 12:16:02.08	2025-07-03 12:33:37.387	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i30101/CrystalEyes-v1.0.0/master/README.md	https://github.com/i30101/CrystalEyes-v1.0.0.git	U091U59K5BL	2025-07-10 11:56:59.331

4012	Super E-Reader + Notes	readsack	/projects/5437	When I saw that my E-Reader screentime was over 4 hrs (more than my coding & social media screentime), I decided, for both recovering my programming hours and in need of a better app, to make my own e-reader. Then I decided that why not make a notes app integrated into the e-reader itself, since I have very specific uses for notes app, as most of my notes are on paper(I like the feel of writing on paper). Therefore, this is a supercharged combination of an e-reader and a notes application. Also I hate using AI for logic and structure, but I can't deny that Copilot sure helps in the grunt work.	276	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-05 13:55:45.282	2025-07-06 05:54:44.211	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readsack/eReader-Notes/refs/heads/main/README.md	https://github.com/readsack/eReader-Notes	U094CRX2C0Y	2025-07-10 11:59:05.366

4029	PigeonRun	Harsh Patel	/projects/5373	Pigeon Run is an inclusive game designed to help players learn American Sign Language (ASL) through engaging gameplay. Inspired by the desire to bridge communication gaps in the gaming community, the game combines Pygame for the game mechanics and OpenCV with Roboflow for real-time ASL letter recognition via webcam.\n\nPlayers control an airplane dodging pigeons, similar to Subway Surfers, but instead of using keys, they must sign ASL letters to move. The game increases in difficulty with more pigeons and faster movement, encouraging quick, accurate signing.\n\nKey challenges included integrating the ASL recognition with Pygame, which required redesigning the layout to make both systems work together. Despite these challenges, the creator successfully built a working game and gained experience in Pygame and computer vision.\n\nFuture plans include expanding the system to recognize full ASL words, allowing players to practice more advanced communication skills.	113	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Video Game	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-05 01:36:07.123	2025-07-05 01:36:07.123			U070DRRF6RJ	2025-07-10 11:59:07.113

4171	Weather-onchain logger	fias abid	/projects/4787	WeatherChain Logger is a hackathon project that brings real-time weather information onto the blockchain. Users can fetch live weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) for any location via the OpenWeatherMap API and record it on-chain through a Solidity smart contract. This creates an immutable, tamper-proof log of weather data that anyone can verify.\n\nThe frontend is built with React – a JavaScript library for building user interfaces – providing an intuitive web app. Under the hood, we use Hardhat (an Ethereum development environment) to compile and deploy the Solidity contract. Users connect with their MetaMask crypto wallet to authenticate and send transactions.\n\nIn summary, WeatherChain Logger offers a simple interface to log weather conditions on Ethereum, ensuring data transparency and persistence.	0	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-07-01 17:55:22.218	2025-07-01 17:55:22.218			U092D5T8E9J	2025-07-10 11:59:22.062

4387	Trust Vendor	franco francis	/projects/3740	TrustVendor is a hyperlocal fast-delivery platform that empowers small neighborhood stores to compete with large quick-commerce services like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, and Blinkit. Unlike those platforms, which rely on centralized warehouses and exclude local shopkeepers, TrustVendor operates without godowns. Instead, it provides a digital storefront to any local vendor, enabling them to sell their products online and fulfill orders within 10–30 minutes in their area.\n\nThe platform allows customers to browse items from nearby stores, place orders, and receive fast delivery — all while supporting local businesses. Vendors can sign up easily, manage inventory, and handle orders through a simple interface without any technical expertise. Payments are processed securely through UPI and cards, and deliveries are managed via store-based coordination or local delivery partners.\n\nThis project is my attempt to democratize access to quick-commerce infrastructure by giving real-world stores the same digital capabilities as corporate chains — without needing to own a warehouse or a private delivery fleet. TrustVendor aims to make local commerce more competitive, efficient, and sustainable by using technology to level the playing field.	4	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Mobile App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-25 17:13:34.906	2025-06-25 17:13:34.906			U091Z3M7YRY	2025-07-10 11:59:43.676

The system stores user ratings and calculates an average rating for each movie, which is displayed alongside the movie’s details.\n\nAdministrators can manage movie data, including adding, updating, or deleting movie entries. The system ensures that each user can rate a movie only once, but they can update their rating if needed. It may also include search and filter options to help users find movies by genre, release year, or rating. The main goal is to provide an organized way for users to share feedback and for others to discover well-rated content.	0	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-22 12:45:45.424	2025-06-22 12:45:45.424			U091QE83A2Z	2025-07-10 11:59:57.217

Built with Python and Flask, Tortoiseshell allows debaters to unlock deeper statistical insights from tournaments (like motion balance specifically for rooms above a certain skill percentile, judge score averages, and side/position frequency among breaking teams) and track their performance across tournaments, analyzing long-term patterns and trends.	205	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-19 20:50:39.826	2025-07-02 00:28:38.613		https://github.com/w-r-e/tortoiseshell	U0926HMV0MB	2025-07-10 12:00:12.695

5011	FarmAI - An AI based project to help farmers.	Siddharth Jain	/projects/732	Inspiration\nGrowing up, I saw how many farmers in rural areas struggled with unpredictable weather, poor crop yields, and limited access to expert advice. This deeply inspired me to create a solution that could empower them with the right information at the right time. I’ve always been passionate about technology and artificial intelligence, and I wanted to apply these tools to solve real-world problems.\n\nThe idea of combining AI with agriculture came from observing how data-driven systems are transforming industries, while agriculture still faces huge gaps in access to information. I realized that even small changes—like recommending the right crop or identifying pests early—could have a big impact on a farmer’s income and food security. That’s what motivated me to build this AI-based platform: to support farmers, reduce resource waste, and make agriculture smarter and more sustainable.\n\nWhat it does\nThis project is an AI-powered farming assistant that helps farmers make smart, data-driven decisions to increase productivity and reduce waste. Based on inputs like weather, soil type, pH, NPKC levels, and farm size, it performs the following key functions:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), based on soil and environmental conditions.\n\nIrrigation & Water Prediction: Uses ANN to recommend the best irrigation method and estimate the right amount of water needed.\n\nYield Prediction: Predicts potential crop yield using ANN, helping farmers plan better.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: Uses a Random Forest model to recommend the correct type of fertilizer based on nutrient levels and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity Estimation: An ANN model calculates the exact amount of fertilizer and pesticide needed, avoiding overuse and reducing costs.\n\nThe platform uses a Next.js frontend for user interaction and a FastAPI backend to process the inputs and return AI-generated recommendations. It aims to make farming more precise, efficient, and accessible for all.\n\nHow we built it\nWe built this project using a modern and scalable tech stack, combining machine learning models with a full-stack web application.\n\nFrontend: We used Next.js to build a responsive and interactive frontend that allows farmers to input data such as soil type, pH, NPKC levels, weather details, and farm size. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and mobile-compatible for easy access.\n\nBackend: The backend is powered by FastAPI, a fast and efficient Python web framework. It handles incoming requests, processes data, communicates with the machine learning models, and returns predictions to the frontend.\n\nMachine Learning Models:\n\nCrop Recommendation: Built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze environmental and soil parameters.\n\nIrrigation and Water Requirement: An ANN predicts the most suitable irrigation method and how much water the crop will need.\n\nYield Prediction: Another ANN model estimates the potential yield based on input factors.\n\nFertilizer Recommendation: A Random Forest classifier determines the best fertilizer based on soil nutrients and crop type.\n\nFertilizer & Pesticide Quantity: An ANN model calculates precise quantities required to avoid overuse.\n\nTraining & Data: We trained our models using agricultural datasets containing soil, weather, and crop data. Each model was evaluated and fine-tuned to improve accuracy and generalization.\n\nAll components are integrated seamlessly, ensuring that users get real-time, reliable insights through a web-based interface.\n\nChallenges we ran into\nBuilding this AI-powered farming assistant as a solo developer was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I encountered several obstacles throughout the development process:\n\nData Collection & Cleaning: Finding accurate, real-world agricultural datasets was difficult. I had to combine multiple sources and spend time cleaning, organizing, and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for model training.\n\nChoosing the Right Models: Selecting the best algorithms for different tasks required experimentation. I tried various models before finalizing ANN for crop prediction, water estimation, and yield prediction, and Random Forest for fertilizer recommendations. Fine-tuning them to get good accuracy without overfitting took time.\n\nFeature Selection: Understanding which input features (like pH, NPKC, farm size, etc.) were most relevant for each prediction task was a major challenge. I had to study agricultural practices and test combinations to get meaningful outputs.\n\nFrontend-Backend Integration: Connecting the Next.js frontend with the FastAPI backend was tricky. I ran into CORS issues and had to carefully manage API routing and request handling to make the data flow smooth and responsive.\n\nBalancing Accuracy & Simplicity: While aiming for high model accuracy, I also had to ensure the system remained simple enough for farmers to use. It was tough to design a system that’s both powerful and practical.\n\nDesigning a User-Friendly Interface: I had to make the UI intuitive, clean, and usable even on mobile devices, keeping in mind that many users may not be tech-savvy. Creating a smooth user experience took multiple design iterations.\n\nWorking alone pushed me to learn, adapt, and solve problems independently, and this experience helped me grow both technically and personally.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\nBuilt a Complete AI Solution from Scratch: I successfully designed and developed an end-to-end AI system that predicts crops, irrigation needs, fertilizer types, and yield using real agricultural data.\n\nIntegrated Full Stack Technologies: I built a fully functional frontend using Next.js and connected it seamlessly to a FastAPI backend, managing both UI design and backend logic on my own.\n\nTrained Multiple ML Models: I implemented and trained multiple machine learning models (ANN and Random Forest) tailored for specific agricultural predictions, achieving good accuracy and real-world usability.\n\nDesigned a Clean, Usable Interface: I created a user-friendly web interface that’s responsive and accessible, ensuring ease of use even for farmers with limited technical knowledge.\n\nLearned & Applied Real-World Problem Solving: I tackled real-world issues like data inconsistency, model selection, and feature engineering, and found effective solutions through research and persistence.\n\nStayed Consistent & Self-Motivated: As a solo developer, I’m proud that I stayed committed, organized, and motivated through each phase—from planning and coding to testing and deployment.\n\nWhat we learned\nThroughout this project, I gained valuable experience and technical skills across multiple areas:\n\nApplied Machine Learning in Agriculture: I learned how to train and evaluate ML models like ANN and Random Forest for real-world agricultural use cases, including crop prediction, yield estimation, and fertilizer recommendations.\n\nFull-Stack Development: I improved my skills in both frontend and backend development using Next.js and FastAPI, learning how to integrate APIs, manage state, and build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.\n\nData Handling & Preprocessing: I learned the importance of clean, relevant data. I developed skills in data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for model training.\n\nModel Optimization & Evaluation: I gained hands-on experience in tuning hyperparameters, avoiding overfitting, and improving model accuracy and generalization.\n\nProblem-Solving & Debugging: I faced many technical challenges, especially in backend integration and model deployment, which taught me to troubleshoot issues methodically and stay persistent.\n\nUser-Centric Thinking: Designing an interface with farmers in mind taught me the value of simplicity and accessibility in tech solutions.\n\nThis project gave me the confidence to build practical AI tools and showed me how technology can make a real difference in critical fields like agriculture.\n\nWhat's next for FarmAI\nFarmAI is already live and deployed at farmai-nine.vercel.app(since its backend is hosted on Render's free tier its backend works slow sometimes), providing farmers with AI-powered recommendations. But this is just the beginning. Here's what's next for FarmAI:\n\nFrontend Enhancements & New Features: Continue improving the user interface for a better user experience, adding new functionalities, and optimizing the app for faster loading times.\n\nMultilingual Support: Add support for regional languages to make the platform more accessible to farmers from different areas, especially those in rural regions.\n\nIntegration with Real-Time APIs: Incorporate real-time weather and soil data APIs to provide more accurate predictions based on live environmental conditions.\n\nDatabase Expansion: Add more crop varieties, soil types, and fertilizer profiles to ensure the system caters to a broader set of geographical areas and farming needs.	8	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://youtu.be/GV4v6cYUlmA?si=HHQWzP0Hty7TgCok	2025-06-17 10:42:42.005	2025-06-17 10:50:25.607		https://github.com/sidjain1239/farmai-frontend	U091RQ4BPEH	2025-07-10 12:00:43.224

It runs automatically (e.g., daily via Airflow), compares live data against a reference dataset using tools like evidently and alibi-detect, and generates both human-readable reports and machine-readable metrics.\n\nWhat makes it special is its full automation and traceability: it not only detects drift but also logs key metrics, triggers alerts via Slack or email, and can even launch retraining pipelines. Each run produces decision artifacts—JSON outputs, HTML reports, and CSV logs—making the system both auditable and actionable.	112	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Something else	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-17 07:55:04.843	2025-06-17 07:55:04.843	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pablovanegas/deriva_agro4.0/main/README.md	https://github.com/pablovanegas/deriva_agro4.0	U091B9Y8DGF	2025-07-10 12:00:46.662

One thing I found incredibly stressful and tiring was trying to collect pictures and memories from several of his friends and family members to compile the funeral video. With this in mind, I created Recollekt- an app where you can create photo albums and share them with friends and family. Recollekt is user friendly and allows anyone you share the album with to add images so that you don't have to go dming every person. You are also able to compile and edit a video of an album to watch with friends and family and take a trip down memory lane.	332	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Mobile App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://youtu.be/ug9k7wWqLDQ	2025-06-16 22:01:46.651	2025-06-16 22:01:46.651	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fs-Zh4ng/Recollekt/refs/heads/main/Recollekt/README.md	https://github.com/Fs-Zh4ng/Recollekt	U08SHA5JHNY	2025-07-10 12:00:55.648

5153	MoodAtlas – Interactive Emotion Mapping App	Joanna	/projects/295	MoodAtlas is a local web application that helps users track and visualize their emotions through an interactive map. Each day, the user writes a short text about how they feel. A local AI model analyzes the emotional content and places it on a dynamic "emotion map" – a visual representation of mental states over time. The app is fully offline and prioritizes privacy. It is built using React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MariaDB (database). The goal is to support emotional self-awareness and pattern recognition without compromising personal data.	255	0	https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/42eb885e3ebc20bd5e94782b7b4bcb31bcc956d3_i.png	Web App	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706		2025-06-16 21:22:29.412	2025-06-16 21:22:29.412	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mimblaa/MoodAtlas/main/README.md	https://github.com/Mimblaa/MoodAtlas	U091QKM09GA	2025-07-10 12:00:57.158

The game also includes a timer to track your progress. Upon completing a maze, you will receive a score based on how difficult the maze is and how accurate your moves are. The score does not depend on the time taken though.\n\nA maze collection is integrated into the game. So, you can choose any maze of your choice to play. You can also choose to generate a random maze locally on your machine instead. You can share either of these mazes with your friends by clicking "Share Maze" on the game play screen.\n\nIf you can't solve a maze, you can click "Reveal Answer" and view the solution.\n\nAI used for code completion (GitHub Copilot)\nMore features like custom maze crafting will be added soon!	91	0	/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI0LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--d81c0d20be66d9bdb70464c58f8f1a56d9f2375f/a-maze.png	Video Game	2025-07-10 11:26:02.706	https://a-maze.jothin.tech	2025-06-16 19:22:56.456	2025-06-18 19:51:04.604	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jothin-kumar/a-maze/main/README.md	https://github.com/Jothin-kumar/a-maze	U09220FV5Q9	2025-07-10 12:00:59.527
